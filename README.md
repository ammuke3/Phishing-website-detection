# Phishing-website-detection
Over the years there have been many attacks of Phishing and many people have lost huge sums of money by becoming a victim of phishing attack.  Internet is an essential part of our life. Internet users can be affected from different types of cyber threats. Thus cyber threats may attack financial data, private information, online banking and e-commerce. Phishing is a type of cyber threats that is targeting to get private information such as credit cards information and social security numbers. There is not a specific solution that can detect whole phishing attacks. In this study, we proposed an intelligent model for detecting phishing web pages based on Extreme Learning Machine. Types of web pages are different in terms of their features. Hence, we must use a specific web page features set to prevent phishing attacks. We proposed a model based on machine learning techniques to detect phishing web pages.


### Overview of the project

Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website.

This project employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Decision tree induction, Na√Øve bayes classification and Random Forest are used for exploring the results.
